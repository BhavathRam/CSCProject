Introduction : 
Amazon Textract is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables users to 
automatically extract text and structured data from documents. It uses machine learning 
algorithms to identify and extract key information from a variety of document formats, 
including PDFs, images, and scanned documents.
With Amazon Textract, users can extract data such as text, tables, and form data from 
documents and store it in a structured format that can be easily analyzed and processed. 
The service supports a variety of languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, 
Italian, Portuguese, and Japanese.
To use Amazon Textract, users can upload their documents to the AWS platform or 
integrate the service into their existing applications using the AWS API. Once the documents 
have been processed, the extracted data can be exported in a variety of formats, including 
JSON, CSV, and Excel.
Some common use cases for Amazon Textract include invoice processing, receipt 
processing, and document digitization. By automating the process of data extraction, 
businesses can save time and improve accuracy, while also freeing up employees to focus on 
more high-value tasks.
